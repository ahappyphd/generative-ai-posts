# generative-ai-posts

This repo contains the code to generate computationally pieces of posts, using ChatGPT and other "generative AI" tools.

For now, I have used [R code](https://www.r-project.org/) to implement this, along with the [openAI R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openai/index.html).
